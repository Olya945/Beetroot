''' Task 2

Implement 2 classes, the first one is the Boss and the second one is the Worker.

Worker has a property 'boss', and its value must be an instance of Boss.

You can reassign this value, but you should check whether the new value is Boss. Each Boss has a list of his own workers. You should implement a method that allows you to add workers to a Boss. You're not allowed to add instances of Boss class to workers list directly via access to attribute, use getters and setters instead!

You can refactor the existing code.

id_ - is just a random unique integer

 

class Boss:

    def __init__(self, id_: int, name: str, company: str):

        self.id = id_

        self.name = name

        self.company = company

        self.workers = []

 

class Worker:

    def __init__(self, id_: int, name: str, company: str, boss: Boss):

        self.id = id_

        self.name = name

        self.company = company

        self.boss = boss
